House is one of the most important part for family and plays important role in economic development. Therefore, this project is aimed at analyzing contributions of US housing prices, then predicting. For our methods, we use Linear Regression and Deep Learning Regression to analyze the factors and their relationships with housing prices, then applying Random Forest to do the prediction. In result, we find out several main factors like the amount of rooms and living square feet. The results show that Random Forest and Linear Regression can provide better predictions.
